# Code-Abbey-Solutions
My solutions to Code Abbey problems, posted here for easy access, maybe it will be helpful to someone, and just maybe will be somewhat of a portfolio for me later on.

I hope to solve all problems from the Code Abbey site, currently only using Python.

I try to comment everything; if the code is complicated enough to justify doing so (as I get better, probably will get more consistent with explanations).

Whitespaces in titles converted to underscores, because it messes with git.

Please do not use my code to grind for the certificate.
